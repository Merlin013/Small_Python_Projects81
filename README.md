# Small_Python_Projects81
 This repository contains mini projects and scripts to learn Python Programming.
 These projects were originally written by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com 
 in his book "THE BIG BOOK OF SMALL PYTHON PROJECTS"

### Project 1: Bagels
 A deductive logic game where you must guess a number based on clues.

### Project 2: Birthday Paradox
 The Birthday Paradox, also called the
 Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high
 probability that two people will have the
 same birthday even in a small group of people.

 

### Project 3: Bitmap Message
 This script displays a text message according to the provided bitmap image

 
### Project 4: BlackJack
 The classic card game also known as 21. (This version doesn't have splitting or insurance.)

 
### Project 5: Bouncing DVD Logo
 This program simulates this colorful DVD logo by making it
 change direction each time it hits an edge.

### Project 6: Caesar cipher
 The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher that uses addition and subtraction 
 to encrypt and decrypt letters.

### Project 7: Caesar Hacker
 This program hacks messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher by doing 
 a brute force attack against every possible key.

 
### Project 8: Calendar Maker
 This program generates printable text files of monthly calendars for the month 
 and year you enter


### Project 9: Carrot in the box
 This is a simple and silly bluffing game for
 two human players. Each player has a box.
 One box has a carrot in it, and each player
 wants to have the carrot. The first player looks
 in their box and then tells the second player they
 either do or donâ€™t have the carrot. The second player
 gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.
